# Arduino-Lift-System
An Arduino-based stepper motor lift system with button controls and floor detection."# Arduino Lift System 🚀


## 📌 Features
- Supports 6 floors (0-5)
- Uses stepper motor driver for precise movement
- Button-based floor selection with debounce logic
- Floor detection via normally open (NO) sensors

## 🛠️ Components
- Arduino Uno/Nano
- Stepper motor & driver (e.g., A4988)
- Limit switches as floor sensors
- Push buttons for floor selection

## 📜 Code Explanation
The `lift_system.ino` file controls:
- Button press detection
- Stepper motor movement
- Floor detection & safety checks

## 🚀 Installation
1. Upload `lift_system.ino` to Arduino.
2. Connect stepper driver & buttons.
3. Power on and test.
